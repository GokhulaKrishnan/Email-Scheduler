Steps in Building this application

1. Configuring the Properties:
- I first configured the needed properties like setting up the Database and JPA

2. Creating the User Controller:
-  We need different users in order to view their bills.
- So creating a controller where we can create, update, delete and read the user

- In the first session, i had created everything needed for User entity.
- I need to test whether the endpoints work correctly.
- I was able to create a table in the H2 db.


//
- Need to check whether the getCategoriesByUserId in Bills Controller works correctly -

- Completed all the testing of the endpoints and it works correctly.
- Need to check whether the sending of email actually works.
    - Cna be done by changing the scheduler to run every 2 minutes
    - Create a new bill that is with the recepient mail id and put the correct date.
    - It will fetch the data from the db.
    - Create a template and send it.

- The email is sent successfully which means that the configurations are correct.

- Now i need to test whether the scheduler works correctly.
- The scheduler works correctly.
- I forgot to put the annotation @Enable scheduling in the Main application and i corrected it.
